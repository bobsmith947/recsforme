## How to contribute to recsforme

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **If the bug may present a potential security vulnerability, it is not recommended to open an issue.** Instead, I may be contacted at [contact@recsfor.me](mailto:contact@recsfor.me).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/bobsmith947/recsforme/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/bobsmith947/recsforme/issues/new). **Be sure to include a clear title; an issue simply titled something along the lines of "problem" will be ignored**. In the description, include as much relevant information as necessary, and (if possible) a demonstration of the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the pull request description clearly illustrates the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the code will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

Once you have completed writing or modifying the code, open a pull request and be sure to include why the new/updated feature is useful to the project.
