## How to contribute to recsforme

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **If the bug may present a potential security vulnerability, it is not recommended to open an issue.** Instead, I may be contacted at [contact@recsfor.me](mailto:contact@recsfor.me).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/bobsmith947/recsforme/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/bobsmith947/recsforme/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and (if possible) a demonstration of the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**:

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question.
