# Contributing to recsforme

## Do you have a bug to report, a question to ask, or a feature to request?

* **If a security vulnerability may be present, it is not recommended to open an issue.** Instead, I may be contacted at [contact@recsfor.me](mailto:contact@recsfor.me). Please include as much information as you can; I'll be sure to give security issues the highest priority.
* **Check if what you have has already been submitted** by [searching here](https://github.com/bobsmith947/recsforme/issues). If yours is a duplicate, please just leave a comment on the existing issue (duplicate issues will be closed regardless of the context), including any details not already mentioned. Closed issues will be reopened as needed.
* If you're unable to find an issue addressing what you have, [open a new one](https://github.com/bobsmith947/recsforme/issues/new). **Be sure to give the issue a clear title**; an issue titled something along the lines of "There's a problem," will be ignored. In the description, include as much relevant information as necessary, and (if possible) a demonstration of the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Do you have a bugfix, new feature, or feature change?

* Open a pull request, with the relevant Issue number(s) if applicable.
* If you fixed a bug, ensure the pull request description clearly illustrates the problem and solution.
* If you changed or added a feature, try to include in the description reasons for how it improves recsforme.

## Do you have a patch that purely adds whitespace or formats code?

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything to the stability, functionality, or testability of the recsforme codebase aren't very useful.
* You're still welcome to submit a pull request, although I'll give it a low priority.
