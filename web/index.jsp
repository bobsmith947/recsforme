    <h4>Alpha Testing</h4>
    <p>Thanks so much for deciding to become an alpha tester! First and foremost, I'd like to congratulate you on joining a team composed of some of the most excellent individuals on planet Earth. Secondly, I'd like to emphasize that you should open an issue or contact me about <i>anything</i> related to the project. Bug report, feature request, design improvement, etc., it's your duty to shape the future of the app, and if you don't say anything about what you want added/fixed/whatever, it may never be addressed. Once again, thank you so much, play around, and have fun!</p>
