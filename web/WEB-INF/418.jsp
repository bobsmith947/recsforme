      <h3>I'm a teapot</h3>
      <h4>You tried to make a teapot brew coffee.</h4>
      <p>Unfortunately, this server does not support HTCPCP (Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol). While your request for coffee was successfully processed, a proper response could not be sent because the server is only capable of making tea. You may request support for coffee making by opening an issue on <a href="https://github.com/bobsmith947/recsforme/issues">GitHub</a>.</p>
